# CGPTritique: Summary of Discussion (2025-09-16)

Context
- Windows PowerShell file copier service for large SVS files with dual-target replication and non-blocking verification, prioritizing contention safety with Windows writers.

What rsync can already do
- Atomic single-destination updates via temp files then rename.
- Robust, restartable large-file transfer with retries and includes/excludes.
- Checksum-based verification.
- Daemon/scheduling, logging, and common one-target replication patterns.

Where this tool adds real value
- Dual-target replication in one pass with a coordinated "commit" (both-or-neither).
- Non-blocking verification that avoids re-reading/locking hot source files.
- Windows-native lock/contention semantics (sharing flags, backoff, stability windows).
- "Copy only when stable" gating (size/mtime quiescence).
- Coordinated integrity across both destinations.
- Windows service integration with queueing, retries, logging/observability.

Is it worth continuing?
- Yes—if these capabilities are required. They’re not cleanly achievable with rsync/robocopy without significant scripting and trade-offs.

Continue if most are true
- You need one-pass, two-target copy with coordinated commit and verification.
- Contention-safe behavior on Windows is essential.
- You want non-blocking verification (streaming or sidecar checksums/VSS).
- Files are very large and mostly write-once, making single-read/fan-out valuable.
- You need a managed Windows service with observability and auditability.
- DFS-R/Storage Replica/“run rsync twice” aren’t acceptable.

Consider stopping or narrowing scope if
- Single destination with atomic rename + verification is enough.
- Infra replication (DFS-R, Storage Replica, object storage replication) is acceptable.
- Basic retry semantics suffice; lock-aware behavior isn’t critical.

Suggested roadmap if continuing
- Atomic dual-target commit: temp files + ReplaceFile/MoveFileEx, clear partial-failure recovery (two-phase-like).
- Contention safety: stability windows, exponential backoff, optional VSS snapshotting.
- Non-blocking verification: streaming BLAKE3/xxHash and sidecar checksums.
- Fan-out architecture: single read, dual write with independent backpressure.
- Idempotency/resume: robust partial-file resume, crash-safe state, exactly-once per file version.
- Observability: per-file state machine, metrics (throughput, queue depth), structured logs/alerts.
- Document limits: SMB rename atomicity, cross-volume behavior, recovery expectations.

Simpler alternatives if not continuing
- robocopy for resilient copy/retry and near-atomic updates (no checksums, no dual-target commit).
- rsync on Windows for checksum-verifiable copy (no dual-target, limited Windows-native lock semantics).

Bottom line
- If dual-target, contention-safe, Windows-native semantics with verifiable all-or-nothing delivery are must-haves, this tool fills a real gap—continue and focus on atomic commit, verification, and recovery. Otherwise, prefer rsync/robocopy/DFS-R for simplicity.
