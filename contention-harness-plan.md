### **Unattended Execution Capability**

**Yes, I can execute this plan unattended with your permission.**

**What I need from you:**
1. **Permission to proceed** - "Go ahead and implement the contention harness"
2. **Commit authority** - Confirmation I can make commits during implementation
3. **Intervention points** - When to pause for your review (e.g., end of each week/phase)

**What I will provide:**
- Regular progress updates using TodoWrite tool
- Clear commit messages following the defined pattern
- Pause points for your review and approval to continue
- Comprehensive testing and validation at each step

**Execution approach:**
1. Work through commits 1-25 in sequence
2. Update TodoWrite tool to track progress in real-time
3. Pause at end of each week for your review (after commits 6, 13, 19, 25)
4. Handle any issues or adjustments needed

**Quality assurance:**
- Each commit will be self-contained and functional
- All code will include appropriate error handling
- Integration testing at each major milestone
- Documentation updated throughout

## Test Execution Strategy

### **Sequential Implementation Approach**
1. **Week 1**: Build infrastructure (can run dummy tests)
2. **Week 2**: Implement 5 critical tests (validate core contention handling)
3. **Week 3**: Add resource monitoring and recovery (validate stability)
4. **Week 4**: Performance validation and integration (production readiness)

### **Test Priority Matrix**

|----------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| P0 | RDW-001 | File Locking | Read-during-write | **CRITICAL** - Core operation safety |
| P0 | DDO-001 | File Locking | Delete-during-write | **CRITICAL** - Data integrity |
| P0 | SAP-001 | Race Conditions | Simultaneous access | **CRITICAL** - Multi-process safety |
| P0 | AOV-002 | Atomicity | Multi-destination | **CRITICAL** - SVS workflow integrity |
| P1 | WDR-001 | File Locking | Write-during-read | **HIGH** - Polling process safety |
| P1 | FRS-001 | Recovery | Process termination | **HIGH** - System stability |
| P1 | CV-001 | Cleanup | Temp file cleanup | **HIGH** - Resource management |
| P2 | CV-002 | Cleanup | Lock release | **MEDIUM** - Resource cleanup |

## Risk Management

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Timing Precision**: Race conditions require precise timing
   - **Mitigation**: Use process barriers and shared synchronization
   - **Fallback**: Retry mechanisms for timing-sensitive tests

2. **Platform Differences**: Windows vs Linux behavior variations
   - **Mitigation**: Platform-specific implementations where needed
   - **Fallback**: Platform-aware expected outcomes

3. **Resource Management**: Test harness resource consumption
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive cleanup and monitoring
   - **Fallback**: Emergency cleanup procedures

### **Schedule Risks**
1. **Complexity Underestimation**: Contention testing is inherently complex
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on 10 critical tests vs all 35
   - **Fallback**: Prioritize P0 tests, defer others if needed

2. **Integration Challenges**: Fitting with existing test suite
   - **Mitigation**: Design for integration from start
   - **Fallback**: Standalone harness with separate execution

## Success Criteria

### **Functional Success**
- ‚úÖ All 10 priority contention tests implemented and passing
- ‚úÖ Consistent results across multiple test runs (>95% reliability)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux)
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing 71-test suite

### **Performance Success**
- ‚úÖ Complete test suite execution in <15 minutes
- ‚úÖ Individual test execution in <30 seconds average
- ‚úÖ <10% performance impact on copy operations under test

### **Quality Success**
- ‚úÖ Clear pass/fail criteria for each test
- ‚úÖ Detailed failure diagnostics and remediation guidance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive reporting with actionable insights
- ‚úÖ No false positives or flaky test behavior
