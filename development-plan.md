# File Copier Service - Development Plan

## Project Context: SVS File Handling

**SVS Files (Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide):**
- Typical size: 500MB - 20GB+ (very large files)
- Format: Pyramidal TIFF with multiple resolution layers
- Usage: Digital pathology workflows with automated processing
- Critical: Cannot be corrupted - medical data integrity essential
- Polling patterns: External systems scan target directories every 30-60 seconds

**Key Constraints:**
- No file locking during verification (polling processes must access files)
- Large file copying must not block system resources
- Atomic operations essential (no partial/corrupt files visible to polling)
- Memory-efficient streaming for multi-GB files

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** September 18, 2025
**Completed Phases:** 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B
**Current Progress:** 6/10 commits completed (60%)
**Next Phase:** 4A - Main Service Logic Integration

**Recent Completion - Phase 3B: Processing Queue Implementation (Commit 6)** ✅
Successfully implemented thread-safe ProcessingQueue with multi-target copy coordination and comprehensive retry logic. Dual-queue architecture now complete with seamless handoff from FileWatcher detection to processing coordination. Advanced state management handles complex scenarios like partial failures and per-destination retries. Ready to proceed with service integration phase.
