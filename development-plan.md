# File Copier Service - Development Plan

## Project Context: SVS File Handling

**SVS Files (Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide):**
- Typical size: 500MB - 20GB+ (very large files)
- Format: Pyramidal TIFF with multiple resolution layers
- Usage: Digital pathology workflows with automated processing
- Critical: Cannot be corrupted - medical data integrity essential
- Polling patterns: External systems scan target directories every 30-60 seconds

**Key Constraints:**
- No file locking during verification (polling processes must access files)
- Large file copying must not block system resources
- Atomic operations essential (no partial/corrupt files visible to polling)
- Memory-efficient streaming for multi-GB files

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** September 18, 2025
**Completed Phases:** 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A
**Current Progress:** 9/10 commits completed (90%)
**Next Phase:** 5B - Monitoring & Diagnostics

**Recent Completion - Phase 5A: Service Deployment (Commit 9)** ✅
Successfully implemented complete Windows service deployment framework with NSSM integration. Features include comprehensive service entry point with console and service modes, automated NSSM-based service installation with recovery configuration, multiple service configuration templates (production, development, minimal), advanced health monitoring with JSON/XML/CSV output formats, unified service management utility with interactive mode, and complete deployment documentation.
